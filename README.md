## Outline

1. What's dedup; why dedup

1. how to dedup
  * Finding candidates, scanning, etc
  * make the page copy-on-write

1. Scanning order (XLH)

1. Free pages (Introspec)
  * Treat them as zero!

1. Not only identical pages (Diff)
  * diff + compression

1. Issues?

1. More benefits
  * Get more VM!
  * Fast migration

1. Dedup on (SAN) FS!
  * Underlying FS: VMFS
